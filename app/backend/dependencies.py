"""
FastAPI Dependencies for Multi-Organisation Support

Provides dependencies for extracting organisation context from requests.

Security model:
- Authenticated requests: organisation comes from the user's account row —
  a client cannot reach another org's data by sending a different header.
- Unauthenticated requests (login, accept-invite, password reset): the
  X-Org-Slug header identifies which org's login is being used.
- Local development: X-Org-Slug header or defaults to 'heal'.

def get_current_organisation(request: Request) -> Organisation:
    """
    Extract organisation from the authenticated principal or X-Org-Slug header.

    Opens and closes its own session rather than using Depends(get_db): a
    request-scoped session stays checked out for the whole request, and on
    long-running endpoints (e.g. audio wizard inference) Neon's pooler reaps
    the idle socket, so teardown fails after the handler has succeeded. The
    returned Organisation is detached — column attributes are loaded, but
    relationships must not be lazy-loaded from it.

        request: FastAPI request object

    Returns:
        Organisation object for the current request
