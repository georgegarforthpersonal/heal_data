# Common Components

Reusable UI components used across the entire app.

Examples:
- Buttons (if you need custom ones beyond MUI)
- Form inputs
- Loading spinners
- Error messages
- Layout components (Header, Footer, etc.)

**Note:** Only create components here when MUI doesn't provide what you need.
